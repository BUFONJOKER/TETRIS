# Tetris Game using Pygame

The Tetris game using Pygame is a classic implementation of the famous Tetris game built in Python using the Pygame library for graphics and game development. It provides a fun and addictive gaming experience where players aim to clear lines by strategically arranging falling blocks called "tetrominoes."

## Gameplay

The objective of the Tetris game is to score as many points as possible by completing lines. The game board is a grid where tetrominoes fall from the top. The player can control the tetrominoes as they descend by moving them left or right and rotating them. The goal is to create horizontal lines with no gaps by arranging the tetrominoes to fill complete rows.

When a complete line is formed, it disappears, and the player earns points. As the game progresses, the falling speed of the tetrominoes increases, making it more challenging to manage them. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the game board, leaving no space to fit new pieces.

## Controls

- Left Arrow: Move the falling tetromino left.
- Right Arrow: Move the falling tetromino right.
- Down Arrow: Accelerate the falling speed of the tetromino.
- Up Arrow or Spacebar: Rotate the falling tetromino clockwise.
- P Key: Pause the game.
- Q Key: Quit the game.

## Features
